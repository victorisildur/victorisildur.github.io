Problem:

  - can't use highlight for I'm using my company's develop machine, which is miserably running RHEL5 and supports python2.5.4 by default. I tried set python2.7 to PATH when running `jekyll build`, that won't work

  - can't serve on localhost. Well, jekyll serve does run, but I can't access it from outer place. Therefore the only option is to build and push to github
  
  * hell markdown not working

  * will new line work?

  * yes it works

Good Parts:

  - markdown

  - yaml? Haven't figured out why use it

  - common layout & template

Goal:

  - try modifying layout(1 day)

  - migrate from csdn.net(1 day)
